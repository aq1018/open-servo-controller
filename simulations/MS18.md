# Miuzei Micro Servo 9g MS18 ( SG90 Clone )

This is a tower-pro SG90 Clone.

## Motor Constants

### Motor Resistance - *R*

**5Ω**

This is measured by supplying 5V of power from a power bench, hold down the motor to prevent it from spinning to induce stalling, and recording the current draw. On average, the stall current at 5V is 1A.


### RPM

**6,000 RPM @ 5V**

This measured by matching the motor noise pitch against a reference pure sign wave pitch. It is determined to be at 600Hz at 5V. Since the motor has 3 winds / poles, and 2 brushes, it will make a sound 6 times per revolution. This gives us 600Hz/6 = 100Hz. Or 6,000 RPM.

### No Load Current - i<sub>o</sub>

**135mA**

This measured by supplying a 5V power and let the motor spin freely. The resulting current measurement is averaged.

### Motor Speed Constant - K<sub>v</sub>

Formula: Kv = RPM/(v − i<sub>o</sub>R) = (6,000 * PI / 30) / (5 - 0.135 * 5) = **145.276 Rad/s/V**

### Motor Torque Constant - K<sub>t</sub>

Formula: 1/Kv ( in standard metrics ) = 6.883 * 10^-3 N*m/A

### Motor Constant - K<sub>m</sub>

Formula: K<sub>m</sub> = K<sub>t</sub>/sqrt(R) = 3.078 * 10^-3 N*m/sqrt(W)

### Stall Current

Formula: I = V/R = 5/5 = 1A

## Stall Torque

Formula: T<sub>s</sub> = I<sub>s</sub> * K<sub>t</sub> = 6.883 * 10^-3 N*m
