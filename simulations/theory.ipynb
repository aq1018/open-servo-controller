    "## Motor Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical permanent magnet brushed DC motor can be expressed with the following equations. For a more detailed explanation, or to understand first principles of a brushed DC motor, please familiar yourself with the [DC Motors: Dynamic Model and Control Techniques](https://homepages.laas.fr/lzaccari/seminars/DCmotors.pdf) paper by [Luca Zaccarian](https://homepages.laas.fr/lzaccari/) if you haven't done so already. I will be omitting quite a lot of the basics here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electric Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following equation models the electric properties of a DC motor. This is basically a LR circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  v_{s} = v_{a} + i_{a}R_{a} + L_{a} \\frac{di_{a}}{dt}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_{s}$ is the ***supplied voltage***. This is the voltage measured between a voltage power source, such as a battery and ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_{a}$ is the ***armature voltage*** also known as the ***back EMF voltage***. This is the voltage generated by the motor coil opposing the supplied voltage. This is because when a motor is rotating, it acts as a generator. This value is proportional to the motor speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "$i_{a}$ is the ***armature current***. This is the current going through the motor coils. This value is proportional to motor torque.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{a}$ is the ***armature resistance***. This is the resistance of the motor coil.\n",
    "\n",
    "$L_{a}$ is the ***armature inductance***. This is the inductance of the motor coil windings. This prevents current from rising and falling immediately and instead makes motor current follow a exponential decay pattern. Eseentially, a motor coil is a LR circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanical Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation approximates the mechanical properties of a DC motor. This incidentally is a good approximation for most of rotating bodies with a damping factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_{a} = T_{L} + J \\frac{d\\omega}{dt}\\ + F\\omega\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{a}$ is the ***motor torque***.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{L}$ is the ***load torque***.\n",
    "\n",
    "$J$ is the ***motor inertia***.\n",
    "\n",
    "$F$ is the ***viscous friction coefficient***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In real world application, we want to provide a PWM signal to drive the motor and control the motor speed. Thus the only input variable in this model is $v_{s}$, the supplied voltage as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find out the following variables in order to provide feedback to the speed (inner) and current/torque ( outer) control loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\alpha$ - motor angular acceleration.\n",
    "* $\\omega$ - motor angular velocity.\n",
    "* $\\theta$ - motor position.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will derive the formula to calculate these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equation For Angular Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "From the electric equation, we can derive $\\omega$ from the motor speed constant: $\\omega = K_{v}v_{a}$, and the electric equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we start by substituting $v_{a}$ with the equation above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  v_{s} = \\frac{\\omega}{K_{v}} + i_{a}R_{a} + L_{a} \\frac{di_{a}}{dt}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n"
