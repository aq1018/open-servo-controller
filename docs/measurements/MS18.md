# Miuzei Micro Servo 9g MS18 ( SG90 Clone )

This is a tower-pro SG90 Clone.

## Motor Constants

### Motor Resistance - *R*

**4.386Ω**

This is measured by supplying 1V of power from a power bench, hold down the motor to prevent it from spinning to induce stalling, and recording the current draw. On average, the stall current at 1V is 228mA.


### RPM

**20,000 RPM @ 5V**

This measured by adding a 1 Ohm shunt resistor at Motor Driver's VGND and GND. The motor is driven using a 5V DC power supply without PWM. An oscilloscope is then used to measure the motor ripple current. Since this motor has 3 windings around iron cores and two brushes, we know that each revolution will constitute of 6 ripples. Measuring the period of the ripple current yielded on average 3ms for 6 consecutive ripples. This is equivalent to 333.33 revolutions per second. Multiplying this value by 60 seconds, gives 20,000 RPM.

### No Load Current - i<sub>o</sub>

**95mA**

This measured by supplying a 5V power and let the motor spin freely. The resulting current measurement is averaged.

### Motor Speed Constant - K<sub>v</sub>

Formula: Kv = RPM/(v − i<sub>o</sub>R) = 20,000 / (5 - 0.095 * 4.386) = 4363.63953719 RPM/V = 6545.459 / 60 * 2 * π = **456.959263765 Rad/s/V**

### Motor Torque Constant - K<sub>t</sub>

Formula: 1/Kv ( in standard metrics ) = 0.00218837887 N*m/A

### Motor Constant - K<sub>m</sub>

Formula: K<sub>m</sub> = K<sub>t</sub>/sqrt(R) = 0.00218837887 / sqrt(4.386) = 0.0010449324 N*m/sqrt(W)

### Stall Current

Formula: I = V/R = 5/4.386 = 1.14A

## Stall Torque

Formula: T<sub>s</sub> = I<sub>s</sub> * K<sub>t</sub> = 1.14 * 0.00218837887 = 0.00249475191 N*m
